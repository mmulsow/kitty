# Shell Notes
Handy shell commands to remember:
```
ssh 192.168.1.82            # Connect to Snickers
ls                          # List the current directory
cd <dir>                    # Change to a new directory
vi <file>                   # Edit a file
python3 <file>              # Run a python file
CTRL-C                      # Stop a running program
```

# VI Editor Notes
